# Dustbin Waste Classifier


## Project Overview

The Dustbin Waste Classifier is a computer vision-based solution designed to assist in waste management and recycling efforts. It can classify various types of waste into five categories and provides recommendations for the appropriate bins for disposal.

### Classification Categories

- List of waste types that can be classified:
  0. Plastic
  1. Glass
